# midiBuzzer

A little project to convert a midi file to something a buzzer can play.

# status

Reading simple midis is ok, need to work on reading more complex midis, in more detail, the controller event has some behaviour I need to read more about. Otherwise I can now try to write it to a buzzer-playable format.

Some testing, just trying to copy the file back to check if nothing got messed up.

I'm using the following sites to help with decoding the midi file:
